2.Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here . You can skip this step if your image is already built:
docker build -t isec-asc .

3.After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
docker tag isec-asc:latest 281200119695.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/isec-asc:latest

4.Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
docker push 281200119695.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/isec-asc:latest
